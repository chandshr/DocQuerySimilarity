The output of similarity between doc and query has been sorted and listed in vectorSpace/src/output/outFile.txt and the output of  and the 
output for precision and recal is stored in outRelevant.txt input files are inside vectorSpace/src/input folder. 

The main java class is inside VectorSpace/src/invertPackage/ReadTerm.java. Here the main class is ReadTerm so we need to compile and run 
this class as described below
Compile: javac ReadTerm.java
Run: java ReadTerm

The functions related to computing the cosine value is done in QueryManipulation.java, precision and recal is done inside Relevancy.java

We can also import this project in eclipse and we can directly run from eclipse.
